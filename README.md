#  Jammming
A React app that allows users to search for Spotify songs, create a custom playlist, and then save it to their Spotify account 

## Background 💡

This is a capstone project for CodeAcademy's "React II" course. It leverages my knowledge of React components, states, components lifecycle, and API requests to build a functional website.

## Features  🧩
- Spotify Login — The first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.
- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library.
- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.
- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
- Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.
